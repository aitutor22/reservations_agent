Reservation Management Tools
Tools for checking availability and creating reservations

ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Sync/Async Bridge Pattern
----------------------------------------------
This module uses a "sync wrapper around async implementation" pattern:

1. @function_tool decorated functions MUST be synchronous (limitation of the decorator)
2. Our API calls use httpx which REQUIRES async/await for non-blocking operations
3. Solution: Sync functions use asyncio.run() to execute async implementations

Example:
    @function_tool
    def tool_function(...):  # Sync function for the agent
        return asyncio.run(_async_implementation(...))
    
    async def _async_implementation(...):  # Async function for API calls
        response = await httpx_client.post(...)

This ensures the voice agent doesn't experience audio stuttering from blocked I/O.

    It calls the async implementation using asyncio.run().
    """
    # IMPORTANT: This sync/async bridge pattern is necessary because:
    # 1. The @function_tool decorator only supports synchronous functions
    # 2. httpx (our HTTP client) requires async/await for non-blocking API calls
    # 3. asyncio.run() creates a new event loop to run the async function

    This function:
    1. Uses httpx's async client (non-blocking, won't cause audio stuttering)
    2. Formats phone numbers for Singapore (+65 prefix)
    3. Calls the POST /api/reservations endpoint
    4. Handles various error cases with user-friendly messages
    
    We need this separate async function because:
    - httpx.AsyncClient requires await for all operations
    - Using the sync requests library would block the event loop
    - Blocking would cause audio interruptions in the voice agent
