ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Enhanced Sync/Async Bridge Pattern
------------------------------------------------------
This module uses an enhanced "sync wrapper around async implementation" pattern:

1. @function_tool decorated functions MUST be synchronous (limitation of the decorator)
2. Our API calls use httpx which REQUIRES async/await for non-blocking operations
3. RealtimeAgent runs in an async context with an event loop already running
4. Solution: Detect if there's a running loop and handle accordingly:
   - If no loop: use asyncio.run() (standard sync context)
   - If loop exists: use ThreadPoolExecutor to run in separate thread

Example:
    @function_tool
    def tool_function(...):  # Sync function for the agent
        return run_async_from_sync(_async_implementation(...))
    
    async def _async_implementation(...):  # Async function for API calls
        response = await httpx_client.post(...)

This ensures the voice agent doesn't experience audio stuttering from blocked I/O
and works correctly whether called from sync or async context.

    and adapts accordingly:
    - If no event loop is running: uses asyncio.run() normally
    - If event loop is already running: uses ThreadPoolExecutor to run in a separate thread
    
    This is necessary because RealtimeAgent runs in an async context, but @function_tool
    requires synchronous functions.
